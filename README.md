WIRE IMG
---------------

Inspired by [flyimg.io](https://flyimg.io), wire-img is a service that allows images to be converted to different format and resized on-the-fly.
This was made just for fun and to learn how to manipulate images with Rust not meant to be used.


Things I want to do:

- Replace image-rs with native calls (dav1d, libpng, mozjpeg);
- Consider header Accept to serve the most optimized image;
- Benchmarks
